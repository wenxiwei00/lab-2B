## LEDs Blinking
This is the GIF of the LEDs blinking powered by GPIO output:

It's worth noting that GPIO data pin instead of the power pin connect to the power pin on the breadboard.

## Outline of What I Plan to Build

* Plan

I am going to build one lamp that can blink circularly. I need five LEDs, and each LED is controlled by GPIO data pin.


* Components

4-5 lighting LED, resistor, capacitor
